# Python for Everybody Specialization

This is a python summed up material from the 'Python for Everybody' Coursera's Specialization 5 course series, including its exercises and assignments.
It's a python specialization program offered by the University of Michigan and it's instructed by Charles Russell Severance.

I will update the summed contents regularly whenever I advance through the courses. I will add nothing from other courses or tutorials so I later can check and compare different Python sources of information.

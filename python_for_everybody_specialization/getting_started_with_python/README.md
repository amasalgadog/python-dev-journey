This course started explaining the role of a programmer and it ends with you being able to write a python code using:

-   indentation and de-indentation
-   if-elif-else loop, while loop, for loop
-   try-except structures
-   break and continue statements

## Introduction

Computers want to help humans and they are programmed, and designed, to do so, and the only think in their 'mind' is 'What do you want to do next?'. Users, on the other hand, they all know what to do next. So, the programmer job is to act as intermediary between the computer and the user in their communication.

In order to successfully achieve this, a programmer need to use tools such as compilers, interpreters, networks, programming languages and more. Python is one of those tools, a programming language that will help you in this job of serving the user.

So first, you need to install python in your computer. In order to work, Python need instructions. These instructions has to follow the language of Python and they need to be written using words the computer can understand.

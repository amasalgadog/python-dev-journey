# Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

<!-- start of section -->
This course started explaining the role of a programmer and it ends with you being able to write a python program using:  

- **int**, **float**, **string**, **boolean** and **None** data types
- indentation and de-indentation
- **if-elif-else** loop, **while** loop, **for** loop
- **try-except** structures
- **break** and **continue** statements
- reserved functions such as **input()**, **type()** and data type conversions functions
- your own functions

Assignments are enumerated following the course modules

## Introduction

<!-- start of section -->
Computers want to help humans and they are programmed (and designed) to do so. The only think inside the computers 'mind' is 'What do you want to do next?'. Users, on the other hand, they all know what to do next. So, the programmer job is to act as intermediary in the communication between the computer and the user.

In order to successfully achieve this, a programmer need to use tools such as compilers, interpreters, networks, programming languages and more. **Python** is one of those tools, a programming language that will help you in this job of serving the user.

You need Python3 installed in your computer so check if you have it by running the following in the terminal:

> $ python3 --version  

This should return something like this:  

> Python 3.10.12  

If it does, you're all done and you're ready to go. If it doesn't, then you don't have python installed in your computer so you'll have to download it from the Microsoft Store or their website > [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Most of Linux distribution comes with Python preinstalled so if you have some linux distro os you shouldn't worry.

# Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

This course started explaining the role of a programmer and it ends with you being able to write a python code using: 
-   int, float, string, boolean and None data types
-   indentation and de-indentation
-   if-elif-else loop, while loop, for loop
-   try-except structures
-   break and continue statements
-   reserved functions such as input(), type() and data type conversions functions
-   your own functions

## Introduction

Computers want to help humans and they are programmed (and designed) to do so. The only think inside the computers 'mind' is 'What do you want to do next?'. Users, on the other hand, they all know what to do next. So, the programmer job is to act as intermediary in the communication between the computer and the user.

In order to successfully achieve this, a programmer need to use tools such as compilers, interpreters, networks, programming languages and more. **Python** is one of those tools, a programming language that will help you in this job of serving the user.

You'll need to have Python3 installed in your computer, so you'll have to download it from the Microsoft Store or their website > [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
Most of Linux distribution comes with Python preinstalled, but if you want to check if everything is in order you can do it by running the following in the terminal:  

> $ python3 --version  

This should return something like this:  

> Python 3.10.12  

And it's all done. You are ready to go!
